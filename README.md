Various scripts I might use later on

1. Average counter

Usage:

Grades format must be:

ID      Grade

ID      Grade

...

Spaces don't matter, but there must be a new line between each ID      Grade entry.

Have to compile through java and insert the file name as arg[0]


2. Bookmark formatter

For djvused

File format:

Chaptername          Page

Chaptername          Page

...

Spaces don't matter, but hopefully there is a new line between each Chaptername              Page entry.

Have to compile through java and insert the file name as arg[0]
